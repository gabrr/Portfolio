// This is going to be my Personal Professional Website.
// Project Started on Saturday 3:50 AM 27/10/2018 Brazil Time Zone.

// The first step was to create a very cool animation for the background, but I want something close to amazing
// it's 6:46 AM I tried to put something like canvas but I think it's complex and it's going to slow down the performance

// it's 8:30 I spent at least 20 min trying reviewing the whole code I wrote because of a bug, but the problem was in chrome.
// I decided to make the whole website from scratch, beacuse I want practice even the elementary things.

//it's 9:33 I'm in front of computer since 9:00 PM from yesterday, I spent a few hours trying to make a mobile navbar with a beautiful animation, but all by jquery I didn't wanted to
set  any classes in CSS, but I couldn't. Even though I addded and it is pretty cool.

// Now it's time to make the navbar desktop version.
// I stopped a bit at 9:56 AM

// It's Sunday 28/10/2018 5:20 AM I came back to resume the work.

// I finished the navigation bar from scratch at 5:38 AM. Including all the animations
with menu, and with responsive design.

// I needed to make some adjustments like make the menu and toggle fixed and adjust all the medias for desktop, or it wouldnt work
properly. Now Ill make a research about Typography 5:53 AM.

// I set a icon pack and the theme and how my website site is going to be inspired of by. 6:21 AM.

// 6:37 AM I gonna look for nice background image.

// it's 6:41 AM I choose three options, But I decided to try make an animations instead of using them, I'm gonna test it out, and see how it's gonna look liike.

// my idea didn't work so well, then I decided to use images. 7:16 AM I set the background image, now I'll write some codes to make dinamic buttons on navbar, the parallax effect and other adjustments.

//It's done 7:53 AM all small adjustments of the navbar, buttons colors, animations and codes.

//It's 8:03 AM I added the parallax effect, But I need to figure out how to disable for small devices. Now I'm going to
stop a bit. 

breakfest time!

// It's 10:04 AM, Tuesday 30/10/2018. I started trying again to disable the parallax for mobile devices since it doesn't work properly.

// It's 10:45 AM I finally maaaaade it, I'm sooo haapy. it was tough but now now looks a very simple code.

// Now I want to make an adjusments to the toggler menu and the navigation menu. 

// Done 11:07  PM I hope no more changes.

// I little look for inspirations for what to do next.

// Done! 11:26 PM I'm more prepared for what to do next. Since I didn't have set a design before, now I'm trying to build it up from now on.


// long break it's Wednesday 2:21 AM. I want to make the main the text of hero match the all the other content and yet put some animation to not look too simple.


// It's 4:18 AM, I play a lot with visual, I was not satisfied with some elements, then a deacrease snav fonts, and tried a effect that simulates 
a white table spining on Y, just 10 degrees, it was cool but didn't  match. I also made a research about the title again and decided to make a typing effect.
it's going to be simple yet, very professional.

//little break; 4:22 AM.

//back to work 4:46 AM.



// I got distracted the new ipad and macbook was launched hehe.
4:53. I will watch a bit and then I return to research about the typing effect.

// I'm back 5:18 AM. It's hard to not desire new products, the new macbook air is very nice. 

// it's 6:32 AM, what a challenging thing, but I made it. it has a very beautiful animation. The best part of this, that I know how it works, 
the next step now is, to change the text,
so it's going to show the first text, when the animation completes, it'll show another text. after all that, I gotta adjust for large devices.

//little break; 6:35 AM.

//back again, after some activities 7:22 AM

//It's 09:00 AM, I'm gonna look for a course of animations, because I really want to input this animation.

// Done! 09:15 AM, I'm gonna try again.

// FINAAALLY IT'S DONE 10:33 AM, that was the most difficult  until now. It has an awesome animation.

// lttle break; 

// It's 10:54 PM, Thursday 01.11.2018. I'm gonna make a few changes, to make it better, like using classes for parallax, so I deactivate and activate easier.
// variables are not possible in css, and I need it since the values have to change... So now I'm gonna do other effect for the hero text.

// I complete by the time 11:40 PM. It's tricky but I developed a way that is even going to work for mobile devices with no problem at all.
Now let's move on, time to check if there's bugs.

//No bugs hehe. 11:55 PM.
Now I'm going to make a bit of research about some technologies that I can use for animating things. As well as grid smart system.


//It's 12:20 AM 02.11.2018. I really want to know how to triggle a container to the window top, so everytime the top of the window reaches the 
the top of the container I can make some animation happen.

/// LITTLE BREAK;

//I'M BACK!! 12:39  AM.

// I ddddddid it!!! it's awesome with so few lines I made a awesome code.

// It's 2:15 AM, struggling with other features which is make the one code works for at once.
without have to rewrite over and over. It's not easy but I'm trying many different ways to make it happen.


// It's 3:30 AM and that one it's really pushing my limits, no one it's not usin plugins, I tried to look at least for idea used,
but it is still very hard to find. Last one I found it's not existing anymore.
I gotta sleep.

// I'm back today is 06.11.2018 - 09:14 PM. I took some classes and was studying Java.
Now I want to fix a bug in my code Typewriter. it's made by CSS and many others had made using many lines of codes of JS. 
But my code takes too much time to start, 6 seconds to be exact, so I'm gonna fix it.

// Done! 10:03 PM. it's perfect now. I just separated the two keyframes.
// always appears some bugs but now I covered each one. 10:19 PM.

break;

//It's 13:16, 07.11.2018. I will start the about section.

//It's 15:05 and I finished it. Next step the tech section, and this one going to take much more time because I will, look for icons and make a few researches.

//It's 17:30 I complete the skills section. Now I'm gonna give a break;

break;

// It's 11:20 AM, 11.11.2018. I am having a problem with CSS grid, for some reason the toggler is moving out of the screen, it seems like last square increases ...

// It's 12:23, I discovered what was going on, but I had to remove a very important element of the website. After a break I'll try to figure out how to implement it.

break;

// It's 14:10 I'm again.

// It's 14:50 and I debugged it successfully.

// I have made few changes in color pallet to things match better. Now I'm looking for inspirations for a Portfolio page that fits well with my design language.


//It's 19:12, I finished lots of new animations, new elements and as well as the new section portfolio.
for some reason the section portfolio, it doesn't look too good I may change something.

//break;

// It's 20:05, I came back, because I had some new ideas, and I don't want to forget.


// It's 22:00, I finished my idea. It was crazily hard, but it works very nice. but now a weird line appears at the bottom of the section.

// 23:03 It's very annoying that line. I took out but it seems like it's still wrong  and maybe that may causes an issue but I made several tests and everything seems okay.

// 01:14 AM,  the mobile version is almost completed, but now it's been hard to align anchor items. 

// 1:56 AM Done!! at least the mobile version. Later I'll need to seek for bugs and make it responsible for larger devices.

// Yeeaah it's 17:25, 13.11.2018. I'm back I am going to try to finish this today.
